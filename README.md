# CS-HUJI-Nand2Tetris
These are my projects from the Nand2Tetris course, completed during Semester A of 2025, including the additional extensions required by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

A few notes:
I received full marks on all my projects except for the following:

Project 6 – 93/100
Project 10 – 94/100
Project 12 – 70/100 (I had a specific issue with my Memory file, which I believe I have since fixed).
I’d like to credit my partner, Dori Peleg, as he is the sole creator of the 2048 game included in Project 9.

Additionally, I have included the tools files provided by the university, which feature an enhanced CPU Emulator and VM Emulator with support for the required extensions, such as shift left, shift right, and others.
